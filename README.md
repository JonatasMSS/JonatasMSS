# 👋 Hi there, I'm Jonatas Miguel
## 🔍Here is a brief introduction about myself 
I'm passionate about technology since I was 13 years old. My first contact with development was when I was 14, when I programmed a game using C# with Unity. Since then, I have been exploring many languages like Python and JavaScript. When I entered middle school, I joined a robotics team called Criadores de Gigantes, where I could learn and deepen my studies in programming and development. I also took a technical course in software analysis and development. Since then, I have been working with ReactJS, TypeScript, NodeJS, and now, I'm entering a college for Data Science.
